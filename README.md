# Circle_Inversion

### About
This program graphs points and their projected points through circular inversion.

Just append as many (x,y) points into the origX and origY FloatLists as you please and rest of the program will take it from there.

### Shape Methods
These are intended to save some time by automating the process of drawing common shapes

newLine(x1, x2, x2, y2);

newEllipse(centerX, centerY, radius, stretchX, stretchY);

More will be added eventually.
