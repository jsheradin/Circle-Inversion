# Circle_Inversion

### About
This program graphs points and their projected points through circular inversion.

Just dump as many (x,y) points into the list as you please and the program will take care of the rest.

### Shape Methods
These are intended to save some time by automating the process of drawing common shapes

newLine(x1, x2, x2, y2);
newEllipse(centerX, centerY, radius, stretchX, stretchY);

More will be added eventually.

### Additional Info
Compiles in Processing 2.2.1

Special thanks to Pi!
